**Objective:**
Create a single page application comprised of 3 Item Cards, each of which will display information to a user wherein that information is a subset of data you extract from a sample public API of your choosing from the following list

**Challenge**:

 - Create a UI that replicates the UI shown on page 2. Note: Book
   name/Image is an example of data from your API that you may display
   to a user.
 - Upon selecting the previous or next button, a user should be able to 
   view a subset of items derived from a list of data. EG items 0-2,   
   3-5, and so on. Your goal is to sift through API documentation until 
   you find an API that has an endpoint allowing for configuration based
   on URL parameters.
 - Use React Testing Library for writing tests.

**Goals:**
 - Demonstrate knowledge of component composition and focus on component
   reusability.
 - Demonstrate knowledge of effective test coverage and meaningful tests (EG testing implementation details vs. replicating user
   interactions)

   respect to developer workflow
 - React Testing Library for tests
 - Core React only â€“ no GQL, React Query, or other packages
